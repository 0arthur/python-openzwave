Installing python-openzwave from repositories
*********************************************


Install the needed tools
========================

You must install git and other tools to get sources of python-
openzwave and openzwave and build them. Look at the documentation of
your Linux distribution to do that.

On a debian like distribution :

   sudo make deps

You need sphinx and make to generate the documentation.

On a debian like distribution :

   sudo apt-get install python-sphinx make

You also need to install some sphinx contributions :

   sudo pip install sphinxcontrib-blockdiag sphinxcontrib-actdiag
   sudo pip install sphinxcontrib-nwdiag sphinxcontrib-seqdiag

To compile the openzwave library, you need the common builds tools and
the libudev developments headers.

On a debian like distribution :

   sudo apt-get install build-essential libudev-dev g++


Get sources of python-openzwave

You are now ready to download sources of python-openzwave :

   git clone https://github.com/bibi21000/python-openzwave

The previous command will create a copy of the official repository on
your computer in a directory called python-openzwave.


Update and build process
========================

Go to the previously created directory

   cd python-openzwave

The following command will update your local repository to the last
release of python-openzwave and openzwave.

   make update

When update process is done, you can compile sources

   make build

Or if you have already build python-openzwave in a previous
installation, you can use the clean option to remove old builds.

   make clean
   make build


Installation
============

You can now install the packages using the following command will.

   sudo make install

The installation script create a list of installed files. So you can
remove python-openzwave using the following command :

   sudo make uninstall


Python3 and virtualenv
======================

The Makefile sill try to automatically configure your version of
python (running python --version).

If you want to install python-openzwave in a python virtual
environnement, you should use something like :

   make VIRTUAL_ENV=/path/to/my/venv build

If you use python 3 and your python executable is called python3 :

   make PYTHON_EXEC=python3 build

You can also put these variables in a CONFIG.make file instead of
passing them to the command line
